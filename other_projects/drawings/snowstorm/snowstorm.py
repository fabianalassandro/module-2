#In this exercise I use the variable "size" that I'm going to add in each functions.
# "size" variable is used as placeholder in order to replace the size with a random size. 
# The random size is created by the last function.

from turtle import *

#pencolor("white") #To allow snowflakes in different colours
pensize(6)
